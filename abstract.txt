Motivation:
Software engineering is a fast moving field with best practices changing rapidly. There has been a recent trend towards hosted solutions which are better maintained and easier to use. These make best practises accessible.

Problem Statement:
Improving the quality of development of an academic project by pulling in knowledge from the software engineering and open source fields.

Approach:
General survey of available technologies, with basic comparison between features.

Results:
The technology is accessible and available, and offers a significant improvement, with minimal investment.

Conclusions:
I expect that the use of the technologies will gradually be takedn up by Academia in the same way they have in the Open Source community.
