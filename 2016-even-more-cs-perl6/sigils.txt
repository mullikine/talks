Why sigils? Couldn't you do without them?

There are several reasons:

    they make it easy to interpolate variables into strings

    they form micro-namespaces for different variables and twigils, thus avoiding name clashes

    they allow easy single/plural distinction

    they work like natural languages that use mandatory noun markers, so our brains are built to handle it

    they aren't mandatory, since you can declare sigilless names (if you don't mind the ambiguity)
